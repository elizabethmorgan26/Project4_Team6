# Machine Learning Voyage: Predicting Survival on the Titanic
## Dataset
Titanic data in Resources folder

## Outline
We will attempt to use a variety of machine learning applications and network types to solve the classic problem of determining if a passenger on the Titanic survived or not.

## Questions
- What were the most important features relevant to survival?
- How can we expand the data provided to add more relevant data?
- Which kinds of models work best and which parameters?
- Can we accurately predict passenger survival on the train/test datasets provided? On an arbitrary train/test split?
- Can we predict for a different target column other than survival?
- What data can we plot to add clarity to the data and our conclusions?
